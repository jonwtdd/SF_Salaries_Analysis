# SF_Salaries_Analysis

This project involved a client-focused analysis of over a decade of San Francisco city employee salary data, examining compensation trends, job categories, and employment status (full-time vs. part-time). After cleaning, processing, and normalizing the data, I applied exploratory data analysis to identify salary distribution patterns, key outliers, and trends in total compensation over time. Various visualization techniques, including line plots (for salary trends over time), scatter plots (for salary vs. job title comparisons), and heatmaps (for correlation analysis), were used to illustrate disparities in pay across departments and positions. 

Additionally, I implemented K-Means clustering to group employees based on salary and job classification, uncovering patterns in compensation distribution. This clustering analysis helped identify common salary ranges and trends among different employee categories.
